    "\n",
    "## Marina Pier Inc. is leveraging technology to automate their operations on the San Francisco port.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The companyâ€™s management has set out to build a bias-free/ corruption-free automatic system that reports & avoids faulty situations caused by human error. Examples of human error include misclassifying the correct type of boat. The type of boat that enters the port region is as follows\n",

    "* Buoy\n",
    "* Cruise_ship\n",
    "* Ferry_boat\n",

    "* Gondola\n",
    "* Inflatable_boat\n",
    "* Kayak\n",
    "* Paper_boat\n",
    "* Sailboat\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marina Pier wants to use Deep Learning techniques to build an automatic reporting system that recognizes the boat. The company is also looking to use a transfer learning approach of any lightweight pre-trained model in order to deploy in mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## As a deep learning engineer, your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a CNN network to classify the boat.\n",
    "2. Build a lightweight model with the aim of deploying the solution on a mobile device using transfer learning. You can use any lightweight pre-trained model as the initial (first) layer. MobileNetV2 is a popular lightweight pre-trained model built using Keras API.\n",

    "# Dataset and Data Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset folder is called Automating_Port_Operations_dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset contains images of 9 types of boats. It contains a total of 1162 images. The training images are provided in the directory of the specific class itself. \n",
